            <br>checks each local cipher remotely.
        <li>-E, --cipher-per-proto

                <br>checks common cipher suites.
        <li>-p, --protocols
                <br>checks TLS/SSL protocols (including SPDY/HTTP2).
        <li>-y, --spdy, --npn

        <li>-x, --single-cipher
                <br><pattern> tests matched <pattern> of ciphers (if <pattern> not a number: word match).
        <li>-c, --client-simulation
                <br>test client simulations, see which client negotiates with cipher and protocol.
        <li>-H, --header, --headers
                <br>tests HSTS, HPKP, server/app banner, security headers, cookie, reverse proxy, IPv4 address.
        <li>-c, --client-simulation
                <br>test client simulations, see which client negotiates with cipher and protocol.
