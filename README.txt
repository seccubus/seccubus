Seccubus V2 README

Seccubus V2 is currently in early Beta phase. This code is currently actively
maintained and developed and is the recommended branch. It works with
Nessus 4.x with both a home feed and professional feed license.

If you are looking for stable code you might want to use the V1 branch of this
project, but be aware that it only supports Nessus with a professional feed
and is not longer under active development.
