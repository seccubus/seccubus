18-2-2011 Seccubus 1.5.5 - Fixed installer error

If the installer changed files by means of the sed command a new file was
created which takes the permissions from the system umask. This cuased some
files not to have the correct permissions as reported by Brad Alexander in
ticket #13 (https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/seccubus/ticket/13)
