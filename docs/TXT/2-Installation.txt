1 How to install Seccubus V2?
Before you install Seccubus V2 you need to fulfill a number of prerequisites. The following software needs to be installed on your machine:
* Mysql
* Apache
* Perl
* Ruby (Required if you want to run Nessus scans)
The following Perl libraries need to be present:
* Algorithm::Diff
* Carp
* CGI
* ExtUtils::MakeMaker
* Getopt::Long
* IPC::Open2
* LWP::UserAgent
* DBI
* Data::Dumper
* XML::Simple
* HTML::Entities
* LWP::Simple
* MIME::Base64
1.1 Tarball (tar.gz)
So you have downloaded the Seccubus V2 and want to get started. This page will tell you how to install the software. This guide makes the following assumptions:
* There is a user seccubus on the system
* This user account will be used to install the software
* The home directory of the user seccubus is “/home/seccubus”
* Apache’s web root is at …
So here are the steps to setup Seccubus:
* Download the tarball 
* Extract the tarball
> tar -xvzf Seccubus-2.x.X.tar.gz
* Run Makefile.PL
> cd Seccubus-2.x.x
> perl Makefile.PL

* If you get messages like the messages below, you need to install some dependancies

Warning: prerequisite XML::Simple 2.18 not found.
* If you see messages like the messages below, you may have an older version then the version used in development. Seccubus may still work, but has not been tested with this release

Warning: prerequisite XML::Simple 2.18 not found. We have 2.17.

* Run make
* > make
* Now you need to run install.pl as root

> sudo su –
# ./install.pl –help

* Running ./install.pl –help will show the help message and show the paramers for the Seccubus install. Now say that we want to install everything in /home/seccubus but place the web files in /var/www/html. We would type the following command:

# ./install.pl --wwwdir /var/www/html/

* Next we have to make sure that *.pl “is recognized as a CGI script” for this we need to add the following line to httpd.conf  and restart apache.
* We also need to add the ExecCGI to the options section of the /var/www/html directory
AddHandler cgi-script .pl

Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

First we have to make sure that the apache user can read the files in /home/seccubus. Edit the /etc/group file and make apache a member of the seccubus group and restart apache

# vi /etc/group
seccubus:x:502:apache
# service apache restart

Make sure seccubus owns all files in /home/seccubus and the directory is group readable
# chown -R seccubus:seccubus .
# chmod 750 /home/seccubus

Now we have to create its database and update its configuration.

* Go to the configuration directory  and copy config.xml.mysql.example to config.xml
# cd /home/seccubus/etc
# cp config.xml.mysql.example config.xml
* Edit config.xml and change the database server, username and password to the values matching your setup
* Now create the database and populate the database with the following commands:
# mysql << EOF
create database Seccubus;
grant all privileges on Seccubus.* to Seccubus@localhost identified by '<password>';
flush privileges;
EOF

# mysql -u seccubus –p Seccubus < /home/seccubus/db/structure_v1.mysql
# mysql -u seccubus -p Seccubus < /home/seccubus/db/data_v1.mysql
1.2 RPM based install
Make sure the following components are installed on you system:
* Apache
* Mysql server

To install Seccubus v2:
* Install the rpm

# rpm --install Seccubus-2.x.x-x.noarch.rpm

* Update the configuration file in /etc/seccubus/config.xml and 

* Now create the database and populate the database with the following commands:
# mysql << EOF
create database Seccubus;
grant all privileges on Seccubus.* to seccubus@localhost identified by 'seccubus';
flush privileges;
EOF

# mysql -u seccubus -pseccubus Seccubus < /var/lib/Seccubus/structure_v1.mysql
# mysql -u seccubus -pseccubus Seccubus < /var/lib/Seccubus/data_v1.mysql

* Restart the webserver and surf to http://localhost/seccubus/ to start using seccubus
# service httpd restart
1.3 Github Clone

# ./make_dist
You can now follow the tarball installation instructions using the tarball you just created or run ./install.pl directly
